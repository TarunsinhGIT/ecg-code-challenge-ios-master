I have created 2 repository (https://github.com/TarunsinhGIT/AdvertisementFramework) is for Framework and (https://github.com/TarunsinhGIT/ecg-code-challenge-ios-master) for Main code.

As per the given task, I have created a separate framework to get Random Advertisements from the given service. In the main code, we need to just add Framework and it will be ready to use. 

Framework : For adding a Framework, need to import "Advertisement" framework and use "CustomAdd" class to get functionality. 

Main Code : I have used observable functionality to achieve the task make successful. I tried to make a fully independent component so in any code, it can be ready to use without any more modification. I have added a Unit-test case for the same.

Improvments : For framework, we can make it more efficient using Clean architecture. I did not focus on the demo implementation part for the framework, It should have proper UI and implementation so when needs to work with Framework, a developer can test it instantly and check for the same. UI test can be added. I did not add a unit test case for all other already implemented classes which also needs to be done if I would have time. Code-refactoring is required.
